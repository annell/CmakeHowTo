# A developers How to use cmake
The buildsystem was always my softspot when writing code, my approach was always to google how to do it and copy paste code and try to get it to run. This is an attempt to take a step back and actually try to learn how cmake work, so that I can actually understand what's going on.
So I will continue to add in random methods of linking in librarys to try them out, just to learn how to organize bigger projects with several types of external components.
